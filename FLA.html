    <p> Female Leadership Academy has helped me in so many ways. It's helped me feel more comfortable in my own body. I have also learbed a lot on what it means to be a leader. I have been able to see things in a different ways and think more positive. You have to take on a huge role because  others look up to you. It has also helped me handle different situations more better. I've really improved in being a better person and using the skills that leaders use. </p>
