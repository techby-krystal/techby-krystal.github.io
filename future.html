    <h2>Highschool</h2>
    <p> I hope to go to either poly or another good school like that. When I get accepted i want to take law and justice class or classes that would be helpful to become a social worker. I am very excited for high school because I know that it is a big part in my life to helping me lean towards what I want to become when I am older. </p>

    <h2>College</h2>
    <p> I am not sure about which college I want to go to. For right now, I know that I have to attend a school that has a good law and justice program if i want to be a lawyer. If I chose to be a social worker I want to attend a college that is very high on classes related to that. I want to have my degree for one of those choices and be able to actually do my job.</p>
    

    <h2>Career</h2>
    <p> I want to be either a lawyer or a social worker in family and children. I want to become a lawyer because I like to fight for what I think is right and I like to help people out. If I don't end up becoming a lawyer I would want to become a social worker. I love working with children and being involved in helping them.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>My goal is to get my degree to become a social worker or a lawyer. I want to be able to make a difference while doing my job. I also would like to have an impact on life inside and outside of my work. I want to be able to have time with my family and also be an amazing person that my younger cousins, sisters, and nephew can look up to.</p>
