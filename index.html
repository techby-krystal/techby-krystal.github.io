    <h2>My Skills</h2>
    <p> I am well skilled in different parts of elements. I am really good at coding, work with technology, leadership and working with others. I have been in the ATM program for 3 years and have advanced in many ways. I know a lot of things that involve technology. I work well with others especially on work, projects, or just naturally getting along with them. Many people can not work with others because of a grudge they have on them. Although, I am different. I can put everything aside and work with them to get my work done. I am currently in a female leadership academy. My skills as a leader have improved and my perspective and ways have also grown. Those are just a bit of my skills. :))</p>

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
    <p> I enjoy doing lots of activities. A few of them are baking, cooking, babysitting, traveling, and photography. Also, not so long ago i played soccer so I still enjoy to play it for fun at times. I really love and get into anything that involves the kitchen. I enjoy babysitting children because it makes me happy and loved. Traveling is something that I have always loved. I would like to go out more and visit places i have never been to. Although, I am not the best at photography I still enjoy doing it. When I take pictures of nature or other peopleâ€™s work it makes me feel a connection between it. The feeling is good and taking pictures calms me down. I am interested in many things. I am interested in math, computers, business and leadership groups.</p>
