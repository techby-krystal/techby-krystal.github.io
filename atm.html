    <h2> Reflection of the program</h2>
    <p> The ATM program has really helped me and has given me a better understanding of technology. It has been very helpful because I can now type fast and accurate and get my work typed up faster. Also, if I wanted to make something I already have the knowledge I need to do it. Also, I can help my friends and family when they are having trouble with something related to technology. I am very thankful to the teachers and people around me who have helped me to better understand ATM.</p>
