    <h2> How it has helped me </h2>
    <p> I enjoy doing lots of activities. A few of them are baking, cooking, babysitting, traveling, and photography. Also, not so long ago i played soccer so I still enjoy to play it for fun at times. I really love and get into anything that involves the kitchen. I enjoy babysitting children because it makes me happy and loved. Traveling is something that I have always loved. I would like to go out more and visit places i have never been to. Although, I am not the best at photography I still enjoy doing it. When I take pictures of nature or other peopleâ€™s work it makes me feel a connection between it. The feeling is good and taking pictures calms me down. I am interested in many things. I am interested in math, computers, business and leadership groups.</p>
